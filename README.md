# curriculum-databases-projects-template

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that where used to recreate a database:

- Used [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Used [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Checked [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
